Firstly	O

For	O
example	O
some	B-Premise

cause	I-Premise
they	I-Premise

already	I-Premise

the	I-Premise

Therefore	O
,	O
exams	B-Premise
could	I-Premise

on	I-Premise
the	I-Premise
exam	I-Premise

grading	I-Premise
the	I-Premise

so	O
the	B-Premise
usage	I-Premise

standardized	I-Premise

is	I-Premise
the	I-Premise
superior	I-Premise
option	I-Premise

them	I-Premise

Additionally	O

standardized	B-Premise
tests	I-Premise
can	I-Premise

some	B-Premise
